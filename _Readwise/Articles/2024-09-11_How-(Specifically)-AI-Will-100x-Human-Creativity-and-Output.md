- Summary: AI has the potential to greatly increase human creativity and output by solving the execution problem. Many people believe that our limitations lie in our lack of creativity, intelligence, or motivation, but the real challenge is execution. Scale issues, such as monitoring large areas of space or analyzing vast amounts of data, and barriers to entry, like limited resources and manpower, hinder our ability to execute effectively. AI can help overcome these challenges by providing the necessary scale and manpower. By leveraging AI technology, we can harness the full potential of human creativity and significantly increase our output.

## Highlights
- AI will solve the problems we have, not the problems we think we have ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7hedjdzxgmr4wep6y4jqfdv))
- Many think we can’t accomplish more because we’re not creative enough, or smart enough, or we lack the motivation and follow-through.
  But our problem is actually execution. We can capture this execution problem in two main ways.
  1. A **Scale** problem
  2. A **Barrier** to entry problem
  I put a bunch of examples of these in the chart above. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7heghxgwcbz4129qhc6rneb))
- Too many logs
  Same with watching logs and alerts in cybersecurity. If you had one server, and a 3-person security team, you can take shifts, set up some basic automation, and you’ll have it covered.
  But at a large corporation, you could be producing *terabytes of data per day* that needs to be looked at. How does your 40-person team stack against terabytes of logs per day? Especially when they all have other jobs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7hep0098vv4h57sk52t391b))
- We don’t need 1,000 more Einsteins.
  We need a hundred billion more interns.
  It’s the same with other real examples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7hepqg5h4aa9q7g1rjekfn0))
- People tend to think criminals get away because they outsmart the authorities. It’s not generally true. Criminals leave trails all over the place, but the team responsible for tracking them down is often just one guy.
  His name is Jimmy. He’s got high blood pressure, a limp due to a bad right ankle, is going through a divorce, and just got a Corgi. Plus he’s got 19 other cases on his desk.
  Finding the criminal isn’t hard, but it’s impossible. There are trails to be followed and clues to be had, but there’s simply nobody to do the work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7heqfrs1repbktx0nr5ty6k))
