- Document Note: 1. How will the shift from traditional corporate worker culture to a more freelance, project-based model impact individual identities and job security?
   2. In what ways can AI-powered agents help individuals navigate the complexities of trust and authority in an increasingly fragmented and inconsistent information landscape?
   3. As processes become more central to security practices, what are the implications for the role of creative problem-solving and innovation in the field?
- Document Tags: #IT 
- Summary: Daniel Miessler's 2024 FrontView Mirror discusses emerging trends, predicting the decline of corporate worker culture and the rise of independent workers. He also highlights the growing distrust in centralized authorities and the increasing importance of AI in helping individuals find reliable information. Additionally, he emphasizes that as security processes mature, success will rely more on structured systems than on individual heroics.

## Highlights
- Corporate workers. I think the concept of corporate workers might have hit its peak.
  Why? Because it doesn’t benefit both sides the way it used to. From the 40s to the 00’s, there was a clean trade in place. Corporations had full control over the worker, and the worker got stability. They had a career. Benefits. Pension. Vacation. Did I say stability?
  Corporations don’t offer stability anymore. It’s far too similar to freelance or contract work.
  The other thing is that corporate workers used to be obsessed with the job. Dedicated to it like the origin of “company”, which is military. Hierarchy. Rank. Dedication.
  That too has been diluted. It’s basically bankrupt in both directions. Corporate workers are largely checked out, and corporations are willing to hire and fire like they’re running a pop-up flea market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rf7rs9ps8q5dse1e7gvbps))
- What to do
  1. Start thinking of yourself this way now
  2. Capture yourself properly on your website
  3. Your Website and LinkedIn becomes your offer of value to the world
  4. Help your loved ones (especially young ones) get ready for this world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfsst022569znpnbrhzjza))
- What to do
  1. Think about all your sources
  2. Remember that they’re wrong some percentage of the time
  3. Figure out how to use them (and the wisdom of the masses/experts) to check each other
  4. Treat most truth as probabilistic and flawed, like models vs. canon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfsgskffxngmj15y96pkq8))
- the more mature a discipline, the more human intervention in a process is considered a bad thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfvqredq3pezy7ztq5ttzr))
- Security is largely the inverse of that. Which is why it’s so fun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfwb92k3wg2kaxdeem40rb))
- All innovation moves the state of the art. Practitioners are wizards more than anything else.
  It’s alchemy, not chemistry. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfwz4phtxjg84zq0xs94pw))
- Well, AI is going to bring accounting to infosec. It’s going to map the inputs to the outputs, pushed by insurance companies. They want to know more than anyone, and they’ll be the first to construct these maps.
  Once that happens, it’s going to get harder and harder to be a wizard.
  That means less charisma-based security leaders, and more CFO types who use data to drive outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfxx2rhr4d5h3afdzpq424))
- What to do
  1. Start thinking of your security efforts in terms of processes, i.e., inputs and outputs
  2. Find every situation in your org where heroism/wizardry is required, and try to replace it with better process
  3. This doesn’t mean there isn’t a place for wizards; they should be dedicated to breaking and improving process
  4. Train everyone you care about (especially the young ones) on how to build great processes, and how to be wizard enough to find and fix flaws in them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rfz1vp5vw43dj38t1f0c9z))
