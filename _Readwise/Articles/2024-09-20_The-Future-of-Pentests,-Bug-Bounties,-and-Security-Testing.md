# The Future of Pentests, Bug Bounties, and Security Testing

- Summary: The debate between bug bounties and penetration tests is misunderstood, with the industry moving toward a model that values flexibility in testing capabilities. In the future, security testing will rely on individual testers rather than traditional companies, as the gig economy grows and trust systems improve. Ultimately, both types of companies may become obsolete, replaced by direct connections between skilled testers and clients.

## Highlights
- • Businesses will eject most internal IT functions, preferring to use vendors instead.
  • The business will retain a small number of super elite IT people who are extremely fluent in both business and IT.
  • These business/IT (BIT) people will manage vendors in order to best achieve the goals of the business.
  • 90% of IT workers will work for vendors / consultancies.
  • Infosec becomes vastly more data-driven in terms of what works for security and what does not, driven by insurance companies being the first groups incentivized to collect and use this information.
  • Insurance companies will determine the infosec standards because they will have the data about what works.
  • Because they will have the data, they know that certain projects need certain types of testing, and other types need other approaches.
  • Based on the type of project you have, the project’s business sensitivity, how many times its been assessed in the past, etc., there will be a best-fit type of assessment for that project.
  • The variables will be: 
  • How sensitive the project is, i.e. the trust level of testers required to work on it.
  • Automated vs. manual testing.
  • How many testers are used.
  • Incentivization / payment structure.
  • The knowledge of the business required to provide valuable results.
  • The BIT person will reach out to several vendors and request an assessment with the precise mixture of these components.
  • Some vendors will excel at specific areas, such as high-trust testers, or testers who know a particular business, but the trend will be towards large companies that can do all of them.
  • Many large testing vendors will really be exchanges that can find any combination of individual to fit a given need.
  • The BIT will pick one vendor that has the best mix, and the work will get done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rg32n2ge753hkxp481tfw6))
- Both penetration test companies and bounty companies need to become flexible enough to handle this entire range of capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8730xcmaw4cssrppa20bg29))
- It would seem to be easier for a trusted security services company to add testers than for pure-play bounty companies to engage deeply into companies as a trusted advisor. But either way, that’s what the race looks like. And both company types must ultimately do both or face extinction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rg99bvbqd3xcgk82dmq5z6))
- The next evolution of the future of work presents a threat to testing companies themselves—traditional, bounty, or whatever. Ask yourself this:
  > Who are the most important parties in the testing conversation?
  *The tester and the customer*.
  Everyone else is a middleman, i.e., a bunch of taxi companies in a world of ride sharing.
  There is, of course, a component of, “Who are you going to sue if something goes wrong?”, and right now that dynamic heavily favors having a reputable testing company (not a bounty company) between the tester and the customer. But as the individual-based economy (and the technology-based trust infrastructure that powers it) gains acceptance, this will quickly decline as a factor.
  As I talk about in The Real Internet of Things, individuals will be rated by trust, by quality, by how pleasurable they are to work with, etc., and they will win or lose contracts based on this rating. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rggwvjg7wxqqzd4dsdymwx))
- The better the middle tech layer becomes at finding matches and ensuring quality, the less a third party is needed between the customer and the actual provider of the service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rgjs3ekw0ye98xt755h3x7))
- **In short, both the traditional testing and bug bounty companies represent the old, taxi model of staffing security engagements, and they’re both going to be replaced by the individual-based gig economy**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rgjxd3cefp2zgxh9jx7r20))
- I look forward to the purity that individual-based testing will bring. It will simply be people with skills and reputations being harnessed to solve problems. And that’s the future of work, not just security testing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rgqc4caqh08b6cvv9djjqy))
- Insurance will be another solution to the liability problem. I can imagine a thriving insurance market where highly rated individuals run with insurance policies that help their clients relax about using them. So not only will they have high ratings in dependability, trustworthiness, and results quality, but they’ll also be covered for millions of dollars in the event of something bad happening. This will further diminish the need for a third party in the middle to take on liability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7rgrkk2rv3n6g9n8p5a1yvq))
- If you’re wondering where this meta on individuals will be stored, such as their testing quality, their trustworthiness, their dependability, etc., I think the answer is in large, universal tech layers like LinkedIn, FICO, Insurance companies, etc. It’ll be all about massive databases of people, transactions, ratings, and fraud detection and defense.
