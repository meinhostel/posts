## Highlights
- The average person has an attention span of 20-30 minutes. o Once you have reached the limit of your attention on a task, you should do something else for a while.
  o Any time you spend studying beyond your attention span is generally wasted time because the studying will become increasingly inefficient.
  o The key to maintaining attention is to divide work into different tasks and alternate types of tasks. For example, you can watch videos for 20 minutes, then review notes for 10 minutes, then work on learning tools for 15 minutes, then get up and move around for 15 minutes before returning to videos ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j91hdxev49yvffve4hew58f6))
