- Full Title: How My Projects Fit Together
- Category: #articles
- Summary: Daniel Miessler is working on several interconnected projects aimed at helping people adapt to the challenges posed by AI, which will disrupt many jobs. His main initiatives include Substrate for understanding and transparency, Fabric for using AI to solve everyday problems, and Telos for capturing deep context about important topics. Together, these projects support his vision of "Human 3.0," a framework for personal growth and purpose in an AI-driven world.

## Highlights
- Here are the Problems that all my life’s work—including all the projects above—is based around (WP = World Problem):
  **WP1**: Humans are suffering from a lack of purpose and meaning in their lives, which is causing mental health and societal problems.
  **WP2:** Humans do not understand—and are not prepared for—the sophistication and speed of introduction of AI into our society, which will cause major work disruptions and exacerbate our lack of purpose.
  **WP3**: Humans are not trained to become full-spectrum people, but rather to become economically useful to a materialistic and transactional economy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qy3r92f5rhcv8y5jnfkkrx))
- Security forever
  There are two exceptions, however, that are purely in my home space of Information Security, which I still absolutely love and will never really move away from. I see AI as *containing* security, so I will continue doing security projects, assessments, consulting, advising, and thinking. It’ll just likely be accompanied by a regular question of “How can I turn this into a (AI-enhanced) platform?”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qy5w0bg5b5mekwv0v9azh5))
- HELIOS—An AI-assisted continuous monitoring and assessment system for attack surfaces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qy68dxvkhhnh9aqj8m9ebb))
- DOMAIN—An AI-powered Security Program management framework and platform. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qy6f8jckanwrp9rs68cxeh))
- security is actually Latin—meaning **se** (without), and **cura** (worry), so it’s actually very much part of my overall mission now, i.e.,: helping people can become their best selves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qy7b6t952fb9kb4rwmf712))
- **Substrate is an open-source framework for increasing human understanding, meaning, and progress. It’s designed to make the things that matter to humans more transparent, discussable, and ultimately—fixable.**
  Application
  Substrate is designed to be used as a map to explain things and solve problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qy9c8e3cpw2f767qva9f7t))
- The project basically provides *handles* for shared understanding and problem-solving. So when people meet each other, discuss things, disagree, or whatever, the various components of the proposal or conversation can be made visible and transparent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qyb5z2hmbmgy8zzbwva0pr))
- **Fabric is an open-sourced framework for augmenting humans using AI. Its goal is to reduce the friction of using AI to solve everyday human problems.**
  Application
  Fabric is designed to help people solve problems in their daily lives. Business problems, personal problems. Problems related to learning, getting promoted, being more creative, whatever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qyca56pv6qvtfxwqn3graa))
- Telos
  **Telos is an open-sourced framework for creating Deep Context about things that matter to humans. The framework allows us to use AI to manage entities of any size, from individuals, teams, organizations, companies, and even larger.**
  Application
  The purpose of Telos is to use it as a structure for defining things we care about and want to improve. So:
  • Ourselves (individuals)
  • Teams
  • Organizations
  • Companies
  • Countries
  • Etc.
  It works by capturing deep context about a given entity so that it can be consumed and understood by an AI (although it’s super powerful even without any AI application). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qyd9g7wb26qa2kk6m81y19))
- Once an AI understands the entity’s purpose, goals, challenges, strategies, projects, KPIs, etc., you can then start asking the AI questions related to that entity. Things like:
  • What mistakes are being made that are holding me back?
  • What if ______ happened, how should I adjust our plans?
  • What is the biggest efficiency I could gain right now?
  • Produce a 5 point next-steps plan of action, backed by research
  • Explain how $EXPERT would analyze my current situation
  • What advice would they give me?

- Daemon
  **Daemon is an open-source framework for personal APIs.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qyfs3bc4ng36g4fz9mty8s))
- Human 3.0 (H3) is a framework and platform for upgrading humans. Its purpose is to help people transition from being a detail in the legacy, corporate-based economy to a new model of success based on self-articulation and expression. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qygkx3q35520bhrmabvtq7))
- Philosophy
  Here are the primary concepts of Human 3.0.
  1. Humans have been trained over the last 150 years to become corporate workers (Human 2.0), and to primarily identify ourselves as that.
  2. This paradigm was never ideal for humans, and its time has now passed.
  3. AI is about to remove/disrupt most knowledge work jobs, which means we have to get ready for what’s coming next.
  4. What’s next is becoming self-actualized, full-spectrum humans that create and offer value to other humans.
  5. This transition requires a different way of thinking about how we learn things, how we define and pursue success.
  6. The process involves becoming radically self-aware, continuous learners who have the creative and financial freedom to spend their time doing purposeful work they enjoy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9qyhyd9enw05ddm6t8fv5yk))
- You can honestly get 85% of what I am offering here by going and watching every video I’ve ever created, reading every essay I’ve ever written, every book I’ve recommended, every article I’ve recommended, etc. And then you could consume all the various GitHub projects I’ve put out that are related to H3. And then you could build your own Telos file, manage it with Fabric, etc. That is absolutely possible, and some of you will do that. *Some of you already have and it’s fantastic!*
  **The H3 Platform is simply a guided version of all that**—where I do all the work to organize the flow, the ordering of topics, etc. And it’s all accompanied by modular videos of me walking you through each concept, tool, and implementation.
