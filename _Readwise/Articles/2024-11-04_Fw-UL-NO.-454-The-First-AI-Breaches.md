- > 💡As per usual, most “AI hacking” will be normal hacking of regular infrastructure used by AI companies.
  > Yes, there will be lots of input validation issues and prompt injection and all that, but the vast majority of the damage will come from customers giving their souls to small startups in the AI assistant / AI girlfriend spaces.

  > From all of our interactions together, what is one thing you can tell me about myself that I may not know about myself.

  > Awesome. Thank you. Can you tell me something else I may not know about myself?
  > Follow it up with:
  > Can you see any areas where I may hold myself back?
  > Let me know what you get back, and if you found it interesting. Honestly mine sounded very complimentary and little like a horoscope. Kind of felt like a scam in that way. Designed to make me feel good about myself, you know?

- Apple's AI researchers found that large language models (LLMs) from Meta and OpenAI struggle with basic reasoning. They introduced a new benchmark, GSM-Symbolic, to measure this, which found that minor changes in query wording can lead to different answers. I find it interesting, but I’d say that it’s easy to disrupt its reasoning rather than that it has none—which is what a lot of the analysis is saying.

- > I find this highly disappointing. People seem to have lost the ability to continue learning about someone once they’ve decided they hate or love them. People are allergic to subtlety. They want crisp, clear answers of Good or Evil.
  > This massively limits your ability to deal with the world because you’re going to be so wrong about so many things. Reality isn’t 1 or 0 like that. And the more subtlety you’re comfortable with, the better your probability adjustments can be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbvwy6ewp1fkr4jjhftfgy9r))
