Ultimately, AI will amplify human creativity, leading to a significant increase in new products, services, and experiences.

- Sure, they’ll be massively enhanced by AI. Their infrastructure, their marketing, their sales, most of their development, and pretty much all the traditional parts of their business will be created/run by AI. And that’s what will let them have a 1-20 person team but function like a 200-20,000 person company. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jct046b2kd5yqvqqn064ya5w))
- The best way to think about AI is as a magnifier. A magnifier of human creativity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jct04r52typdv76w60wpj3a7))
