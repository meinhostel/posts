## Highlights
- In short, the inability for the left/center to speak honestly about immigration/culture issues means they give all the power to the far right. Which means the issues aren’t likely to be approached with empathy and humanism, but rather with hatred and bigotry. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpg13kqfw8fex4da5gmey4w))
- • I think 2025 is pretty likely (80) to hit a tipping point of usability and consistency in 2025, which will mangify the effectiveness of all the AI that was build from 2022-2024
  • Agents are—in my opinion—what get us to AGI. Not one particular standalone model, but Agentic Systems that can perform tasks as good or better than a certain level of competent human knowlege worker ([see my AI definitions here](https://danielmiessler.com/p/raid-ai-definitions)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpgd6bwexyt8swag7dhe2en))
- So basically, if you purchase an AI Employee from Accenture, for example, you’re actually buying a pretty complex system behind that. It’s a network of AI Agents operating together in a way that feels like one thing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpgd0vm4rmy6274529qp827))

  • Will this definition of AGI happen in 2025? Who knows. I think it’s possible, but I’d put it at something like 70% chance of happening in 2025
  • My sweet spot for AGI—using the definition above is more like 2026-2027 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpgdvkp1nxvvgrb8p7dvwb8))

  • This one is the hardest to predict for similar reasons to the AI situation
  • I anticipate a lot more business and optimism and activity, which will naturally lead to more hiring
  • But at the same time there will be a lot more layoffs due to downsizing and optimizing—much of which will involve the migration to AI
  • So you could be part of both or either of these. Prepare for both
  • The safest place to be, in my opinion, is to be moving towards Human 3.0 where you are building and selling your own products and services ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpgkhedqwkdck453qtzmzfr))
