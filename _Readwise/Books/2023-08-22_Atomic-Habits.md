## Highlights
- The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book, you must first become the book.” ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=178))
- The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=190))
- “the aggregation of marginal gains,” ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=219))
- WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=246))
- easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=247))
- Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=248))
- we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=249))
- The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=251))
- habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=260))
- We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=265))
- If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=268))
- It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=270))
- Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=278))
- You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=280))
- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=284))
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. Habits are a double-edged sword. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=289))
- In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=324))
- “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.19 Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=341))
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=379))
- Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=383))
- Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=388))
- Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=395))
- We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=396))
- Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=398))
- goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=404))
- systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=407))
- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=414))
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=419))
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. ■ Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. ■ Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. ■ An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. ■ If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. ■ You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=430))
- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=447))
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=496))
- Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=509))
- When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=517))
- When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs.4 You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=527))
- Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=533))
- Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=536))
- More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=543))
- When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=544))
- Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=548))
- The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=569))
- New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=581))
- That’s fine. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=587))
- Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=597))
- it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=603))
- ■ There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. ■ The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. ■ Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. ■ Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ■ The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=617))
- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=648))
- Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”5 ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=662))
- As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.6 You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=663))
- Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.8 It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=672))
- Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=700))
- Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=703))
- You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=704))
- You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=705))
- Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=705))
- In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=734))
- We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire. ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=741))
- Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying? ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=773))
- ■ A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. ■ The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. ■ Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. ■ The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying. ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=782))
- This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. It’s also what makes them dangerous. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=825))
- You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=828))
- If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=843))
- We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=867))
- There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=899))
- That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=899))
- “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=903))
- Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=947))
- recording the time ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=949))
- appointment. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=949))
- The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=966))
- There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=976))
- The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=980))
- The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.14 ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1001))
- Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1005))
- The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” For example: ■ Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute. ■ Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes. ■ Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened today. ■ Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss. ■ Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am running and how long it will take. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1014))
- Your morning routine habit stack might look like this: After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1030))
- Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1044))
- Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1046))
- Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. (“One in, one out.” ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1049))
- Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1051))
- No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1053))
- Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1057))
- One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1060))
- In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For example: ■ The sun rises. ■ You get a text message. ■ The song you are listening to ends. ■ The sun sets. Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1076))
- In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).3 It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.”4 In other words, customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1125))
    - Note: studium
- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1182))
- The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment. ([Location 1207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1207))
- Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1215))
- When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.” ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1219))
- If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1233))
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. ■ Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. ■ Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. ■ Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. ■ It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1242))
- When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.

- yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1278))
- Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1290))
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1315))
- inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. ■ Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. ■ People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. ■ One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. ■ Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

- A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1371))

- Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss point” for each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1390))
- overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the human brain. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1392))
- We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1406))
- While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the dopamine spike. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1408))
- Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. ([Location 1428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1428))
- When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1432))
- Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.17 ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1435))
- Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1438))
- The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn). ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1484))
- The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. ■ The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. ■ Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. ■ It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. ([Location 1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1513))
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. ([Location 1519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1519))
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. ■ We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. ■ We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ■ One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. ■ The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. ■ If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

- Find love and reproduce = using Tinder ■ Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook ■ Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram ■ Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google ■ Achieve status and prestige = playing video games Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.
