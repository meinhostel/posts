## Highlights
- our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=1882))
- For example, postmodernist thinkers describe nationalism as a deadly plague that spread throughout the world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, causing wars, oppression, hate and genocide. ([Location 3732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3732))
- Many arms races bankrupt all those who take part in them, without really changing the military balance of power. ([Location 3737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3737))
- but meanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in education or health are spent on weapons. ([Location 3740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3740))
- an arms race, like a gene, has no awareness – it does not consciously seek to survive and reproduce. Its spread is the unintended result of a powerful dynamic.) ([Location 3742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3742))
- There is no basis for thinking that the most successful cultures in history are necessarily the best ones for Homo sapiens. ([Location 3745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3745))
- Like evolution, history disregards the happiness of individual organisms. And individual humans, for their part, are usually far too ignorant and weak to influence the course of history to their own advantage. ([Location 3745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=3745))
- What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? ([Location 4343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4343))
- Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in ([Location 4344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4344))
- a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages. When the technological bonanza began, Europeans could harness it far better than anybody ([Location 4344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4344))
- else. ([Location 4346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4346))
- Yet to understand modern economic history, you really need to understand just a single word. The word is growth. For better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy has been growing like a hormone-soused teenager. ([Location 4698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4698))
- Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes. ([Location 4722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4722))
- The entire enterprise is thus founded on trust in an imaginary future – the trust that the entrepreneur and the banker have in the bakery of their dreams, along with the contractor’s trust in the future solvency of the bank. ([Location 4733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4733))
- The Mississippi Bubble was one of history’s most spectacular financial crashes. ([Location 4994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=4994))
- As Marx and other social critics quipped, Western governments were becoming a capitalist trade union. ([Location 5015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5015))
- The most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of big money was the First Opium War, fought between Britain and China (1840–42). ([Location 5016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5016))
- Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong ([Location 5025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5025))
- Kong, which they proceeded to use as a secure base for drug trafficking (Hong Kong remained in British hands until 1997). ([Location 5025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5025))
- Ardent capitalists tend to argue that capital should be free to influence politics, but politics should not be allowed to influence capital. They argue that when governments interfere in the markets, political interests cause them to make unwise investments that result in slower growth. For example, a government may impose heavy taxation on industrialists and use the money to give lavish unemployment benefits, which are popular with voters. In the view of many business people, it would be far better if the government left the money with them. They would use it, they claim, to open new factories and hire the unemployed. ([Location 5057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5057))
- It is the job of political systems to ensure trust by legislating sanctions against cheats and to establish and support police forces, courts and jails which will enforce the law. When kings fail to do their jobs and regulate the markets properly, it leads to loss of trust, dwindling credit and economic depression. ([Location 5070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5070))
- This is the fly in the ointment of free-market capitalism. It cannot ensure that profits are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner. On the contrary, the craving to increase profits and production blinds ([Location 5107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5107))
- people to anything that might stand in the way. When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe. Some religions, such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred. Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed. ([Location 5109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5109))
- Just as the Atlantic slave trade did not stem from hatred towards Africans, so the modern animal industry is not motivated by animosity. Again, it is fuelled by indifference. Most people who produce and consume eggs, milk and meat rarely stop to think about the fate of the chickens, cows or pigs whose flesh and emissions they are eating. ([Location 5302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5302))
- Yet it’s not enough just to produce. Somebody must also buy the products, or industrialists and investors alike will go bust. To prevent this catastrophe and to make sure that people will always buy whatever new stuff industry produces, a new kind of ethic appeared: consumerism. ([Location 5353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5353))
- Markets and states do so by fostering ‘imagined communities’ that contain millions of strangers, and which are tailored to national and commercial needs. ([Location 5588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5588))
- The Soviet collapse in 1989 was even more peaceful, despite the eruption of ethnic conflict in the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Never before has such a mighty empire disappeared so swiftly and so quietly. ([Location 5707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5707))
- Yet the Soviet elite, and the Communist regimes through most of eastern Europe (Romania and Serbia were the exceptions), chose not to use even a tiny fraction of this military power. When its members realised that Communism was bankrupt, they renounced force, admitted their failure, packed their suitcases and went home. ([Location 5712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5712))
- With very few exceptions, since 1945 states no longer invade other states in order to conquer and swallow them up. ([Location 5719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5719))
- We seldom think of the Arab world as particularly peaceful. ([Location 5727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5727))
- Yet there have been no full-scale international wars among the Arab states except the Gulf War. ([Location 5730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5730))
- Even widening the scope to include the entire Muslim world adds only one more example, the Iran–Iraq War. There was no Turkey–Iran War, Pakistan–Afghanistan War, or Indonesia–Malaysia War. ([Location 5731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5731))
- In Africa things are far less rosy. But even there, most conflicts are civil wars and coups. Since African states won their independence in the 1960s and 1970s, very few countries have invaded one another in the hope of conquest. ([Location 5733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5733))
- Never before has peace been so ([Location 5749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5749))
- prevalent that people could not even imagine war. ([Location 5749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5749))
- First and foremost, the price of war has gone up dramatically. The Nobel Peace Prize to end all peace prizes should have been given to Robert Oppenheimer and his fellow architects of the atomic bomb. ([Location 5754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5754))
- Nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into collective suicide, and made it impossible to seek world domination by force of arms. ([Location 5755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5755))
- While war became less profitable, peace became more lucrative than ever. ([Location 5770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5770))
- There is a positive feedback loop between all these four factors. The threat of nuclear holocaust fosters pacifism; when pacifism spreads, war recedes and trade flourishes; and trade increases both the profits of peace and the costs of war. Over time, this feedback loop creates another obstacle to war, which may ultimately prove the most important of all. The tightening web of international connections erodes the independence of most countries, lessening the chance that any one of them might single-handedly let slip the dogs of war. ([Location 5780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5780))
- As explained in Chapter 11, we are witnessing the formation of a global empire. Like previous empires, this one, too, enforces peace within its borders. And since its borders cover the entire globe, the World Empire effectively enforces world peace. ([Location 5786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5786))
- Was the late Neil Armstrong, whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless hunter-gatherer who 30,000 years ago left her handprint on a wall in Chauvet ([Location 5806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5806))
- Cave? If not, what was the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry? ([Location 5807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5807))
- Historians seldom ask such questions. ([Location 5808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5808))
- Most current ideologies and political programmes are based on rather flimsy ideas concerning the real source of human happiness. ([Location 5810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5810))
- Since humans generally use their capabilities to alleviate miseries and fulfil aspirations, it follows that we must be happier ([Location 5822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5822))
- than our medieval ancestors, and they must have been happier than Stone Age hunter-gatherers. ([Location 5823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5823))
- When humans learned to farm in the Agricultural Revolution, their collective power to shape their environment increased, but the lot of many individual humans grew harsher. Peasants had to work harder than foragers to eke out less varied and nutritious food, and they were far more exposed to disease and exploitation. ([Location 5825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5825))
- Some challengers of this view take a diametrically opposed position. They argue for a reverse correlation between human capabilities and happiness. ([Location 5831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5831))
- The transition first to agriculture and then to industry has condemned us to living unnatural lives that cannot give full expression to our inherent ([Location 5833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5833))
- inclinations and instincts, and therefore cannot satisfy our deepest yearnings. ([Location 5834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5834))
- A more nuanced position takes the middle road. Until the Scientific Revolution there was no clear correlation between power and happiness. ([Location 5840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5840))
- Medieval peasants may indeed have been more miserable than their hunter-gatherer forebears. But in the last few centuries humans have learned to use their capacities more wisely. ([Location 5841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5841))
- When judging modernity, it is all too tempting to ([Location 5850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5850))
- take the viewpoint of a twenty-first-century middle-class Westerner. We must not forget the viewpoints of a nineteenth-century Welsh coal miner, Chinese opium addict or Tasmanian Aborigine. ([Location 5850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5850))
- Secondly, even the brief golden age of the last half-century may turn out to have sown the seeds of future catastrophe. ([Location 5852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5852))
- Perhaps people in modern affluent societies suffer greatly from alienation and meaninglessness despite their prosperity. ([Location 5865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5865))
- Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part ([Location 5899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5899))
- This raises the possibility that the immense improvement in material conditions over the last two centuries was offset by the collapse of the family and the community. If so, the average person might well be no happier today than in 1800. ([Location 5905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5905))
- Biologists hold that our mental and emotional world is governed by biochemical mechanisms shaped by millions of years of evolution. Like all other mental states, our subjective well-being is not determined by external parameters such as salary, social relations or political rights. Rather, it is determined by a complex system of nerves, neurons, synapses and various biochemical substances such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. ([Location 5960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5960))
- Nobody is ever made happy by winning the lottery, buying a house, getting a promotion or even finding true love. People are made happy by one thing and one thing ([Location 5963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5963))
- only – pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who just won the lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is not really reacting to the money or the lover. She is reacting to various hormones coursing through her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals flashing between different parts of her brain. ([Location 5964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5964))
- Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too happy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant sensations. ([Location 5970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=5970))
- Most history books focus on the ideas of great thinkers, the bravery of warriors, the charity of saints and the creativity of artists. They have much to tell about the weaving and unravelling of social structures, about the rise and fall of empires, about the discovery and spread of technologies. Yet they say nothing about how all this influenced the happiness and suffering of individuals. This is the biggest lacuna in our understanding of history. We had better start filling it. ([Location 6141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6141))
- genetic codes from a completely different ([Location 6161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6161))
- Retina Implant, a government-sponsored German company, is developing a retinal prosthesis that may allow blind people to gain partial vision. ([Location 6284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6284))
- Yet of all the projects currently under development, the most revolutionary is the attempt to devise a direct two-way brain-computer interface that will allow computers to read the electrical signals of a human brain, simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn. What if such interfaces are used to directly link a brain to the Internet, or to directly link several brains to each other, thereby creating a sort of Inter-brain-net? ([Location 6314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6314))
- Recent advances in machine learning already enable present-day computer programs to evolve by themselves. Though the program is initially coded by human engineers, it can subsequently acquire new information on its own, teach itself new skills and gain insights that go beyond those of its human creators. ([Location 6326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6326))
- The Frankenstein myth confronts Homo sapiens with the fact that the last days are fast approaching. Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe destroys us first, the pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques, but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds. ([Location 6391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6391))
- What we should take seriously is the idea that the next stage of history will include not only technological and organisational transformations, but also fundamental transformations in human consciousness and identity. And these could be transformations so fundamental that they will call the very term ‘human’ into question. ([Location 6409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6409))
- After all, today’s debate between today’s religions, ideologies, nations and classes will in all likelihood disappear along with Homo sapiens. If our successors indeed function on a different level of consciousness (or perhaps possess something beyond consciousness that we cannot even conceive), it seems doubtful that Christianity or Islam will be of interest to them, that their social organisation could be Communist or capitalist, or that their genders could be male or female. ([Location 6416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6416))
- And yet the great debates of history are important because at least the first generation of these gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of their human designers. ([Location 6419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6419))
- Would they be created in the image of capitalism, of Islam, or of feminism? The answer to this question might send them careening in entirely different directions. ([Location 6420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6420))
- Gilgamesh Project. ([Location 6426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6426))
- Nine out of ten times you’ll get the same standard answer: we are doing it to cure diseases and save human lives. Even though the implications of creating a mind inside a computer are far more dramatic than curing psychiatric illnesses, this is the standard justification given, because nobody can argue with it. This is why the Gilgamesh Project is the flagship of science. ([Location 6427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6427))
- The only thing we can try to do is to influence the direction scientists are taking. But since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, the real question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’, but ‘What do we want to want?’ Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven’t given it enough thought. ([Location 6431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6431))
- Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created far-flung trade networks. But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals. ([Location 6439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6439))
- We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. ([Location 6446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6446))
- We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction. ([Location 6448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6448))
- Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want? ([Location 6450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=6450))
