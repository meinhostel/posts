Do you mean,  
Where I am built?  
The walls I hold?  
The dreams I’ve fulfilled?  

What am I?  

Do you mean what I’ve seen?  
The laughter within?  
The warmth I share,  
Or where I begin?  

Do you mean,  
The songs I have heard?  
The moments of peace,  
Where silence stirred?  

Do you mean—  
The hands I have held?  
The bonds I have sown?  
The times I’ve been called  
A place like home?  

What am I?  

I guess what I am  
Is exactly what you need—  
A space for your journey,  
A pause for your speed.  
Not just a roof,  
But a breath and a spark,  
A haven of light  
In the world's vast arc.
